# Brief Introduction

How important is programming for data journalists? This is the main topic of this assignment. 
And I study this problem from two perspective: **Github contributions** and **Twitter text.**

- Github contributions: In the assignment1, some Github records of data journalists were crawled and analyzed. 
Based on the existing data,I will dig deeper into the effective information of specific regions. 

- Twitter text: Crawl 100 tweets from all US data journalists and perform text analysis and word frequency statistics.
