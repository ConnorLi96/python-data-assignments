# Brief Introduction

How important is programming for data journalists? This is the main topic of this assignment. 
And I study this problem from two perspective: **Github contributions** and **Twitter text.**

- Github contributions: In the assignment1, some Github records of data journalists were crawled and analyzed. 
Based on the existing data,I will dig deeper into the effective information of specific regions. Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ConnorLi96/python-data-assignments/blob/master/assignment2/Contribution%20Analysis%20In%20US.ipynb) to check it.

- Twitter text: Crawl 100 tweets from all US data journalists and perform text analysis and word frequency statistics. Please click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ConnorLi96/python-data-assignments/blob/master/assignment2/Twitter%20WordCLoud.ipynb) to check it.
