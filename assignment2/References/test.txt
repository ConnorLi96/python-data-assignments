Minneapolis finished sending us cases last week (request was filed in May 2017). Itasca County sent their cases recently, 10 months after our request. Anoka County is only one with cases yet to send.In part 5, we turned to the prosecutors. Out of the 25% of reported cases referred , prosecutors reject half of them, including some that have DNA evidence, witnesses and sometimes even confessions.In part 4, we focused on the police departments, where inadequate resources mean investigators are "redlining" cases that appear too hard to solve http://www.startribune.com/how-alcohol-foils-rape-investigations-in-minnesota-denied-justice-part-three/488413421/ ….In part 3, we showed how alcohol complicates cases even more.In part 2, we showed that these investigative failures are letting repeat rapists slip through.In part 1, our investigation shows chronic errors and investigative failings by Minnesota's law enforcement agencies. Only about 25% of cases make it to a prosecutor, less than 10% result in a conviction.A caring cop, a confident prosecutor and a devoted advocate proved it's possible to get justice for a rape victim, even in the most difficult cases.

Most don’t result in charges or convictions.

This one was different.

http://strib.mn/2DwDHNE So many rape cases are mishandled, marked by quick, lazy assumptions and failure to take the most basic of investigative steps. 
Here's a powerful account of an outlier—an investigation done right.

She was showboating. She was this, that, and whatever. Too many liberals accepted as true what liberalism’s enemies said about it and them.10. This “narrative” drew the ire of liberals who would have otherwise cheered Ocasio-Cortez. It rekindled the battle between the youngs and the olds, between “centrists” and “leftists,” and between “insurgents” and “the establishment.”9. AshLee Strong paved the way for every Capitol Hill reporter to tell a story they had been wanting to tell even though the narrative” was based on a falsehood: that this unruly mob can’t be controlled.8. From this point onward, Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t doing what a young dynamic liberal legislator does. No, no, no! She was “protesting” Pelosi!Hey US media folks, here, I would argue immodestly, is how you interview a Trump supporter on Trump's lies:The never-ending conservative tantrum over "bias" on platforms is a paranoid fantasy birthed by right-pandering clickbait that has justified the withholding of factual findings on Russian misinformation campaignsThe result was the removal of human judgment calls from what kind of news people saw on Facebook, and the informational dystopia we live todayThe original story had a conservative source complaining about humans using editorial judgment to pick "liberal media" over, say, Breitbart.

You put something in an envelope, lick a sticker, hand it to someone, and they literally bring it anywhere in the world. That’s wild! Shout out to the post office.A little sermon on rigor by @zacharylipton:

- research is an act of contribution, not of acquiring currency;
- communicate clearly;
- don’t confuse newbies about what the open questions are;
- prioritize novel knowledge, not novel architecture;

Recommend reading them to get a sense of how we are housing more than 40,000 people in immigration detention.Our amazing team, @talya_cooper @mahaxahmed @jlosc9, read every single one of 1,224 harrowing complaints and categorized the data.

A breakdown of the complaints shows that a vast majority of complaints are of physical sexual assault. 

In 37 complaints, the victim was a child.Our analysis showed that in a staggering 59% of sexual abuse complaints the accused perpetrator was an ICE officer/contractor. 

In 35% of complaints, an official was a witness. 

And in 22% of complaints, at least one official was the perpetrator while another officer witnessed.Read @alicesperi's story, based on a FOIA she filed, showing a clear pattern of sexual abuse in immigration detention across this country.

From 2010-2017, there were 1,224 complaints of sexual abuse in ICE detention and OIG only ran 43 investigations.

That would be his lasting legacy.The pressure is on this trio — Manchin, Collins, Flake. 

Murkowski looks like a NO given her cloture vote. 

If Manchin holds as a YES, Democrats need BOTH Collins and Flake to block Kavanaugh bc a 50-50 tie would be broken by PenceToday’s awards event was a good reminder of how tough this year was as an organization and how so many people stepped up at many levels to lead us forward.And I’m SO SO SO thrilled that the NPR diversity award went to @mallory_yu @katchow @christinacala @AnjuliSastry They saw a need for a Women Of Color mentorship program at NPR and didn’t wait.

https://www.xkcd.com/2068/ Just tried to retweeted an email, AMA.(Obviously, you could think the law in general, or the SALT cap specifically, was a bad idea even if you personally got a tax cut. I’m not here to argue whether it was good or bad policy.)But anecdotally, a lot of people who think they got a tax increase because of SALT actually got a tax cut. In many cases, AMT meant they weren’t really deducting property taxes even if they thought they were.This is not true for every individual, of course. @TaxPolicyCenter estimates about 2m households that took SALT deduction will get net tax increase.Yes, but worth emphasizing: Most people, even in NY/NJ/CA will get a tax cut. True even among income groups with high state/local taxes. They’ll get smaller cut than if SALT deduction had stayed uncapped, but will still pay less than before.Uh oh, looks like @michaelmirer has to find a new excuse not to give to Columbia.cc @NateSilver538, who was asking about this last week.How badly did GOP do in SALT country? In the 20 GOP-held districts with the highest share of residents taking the deduction, Republicans lost 10.Meanwhile, there's no evidence Republicans did better in places that got a larger tax cut. So TCJA hurt them in SALT-y areas, but didn't help them in places that disproportionately benefited from the law.(Nerd note: We're working with individual-level data here. So we have an easier time isolating SALT impact than if we were just working with district-level aggregates.)And people in high-SALT areas were significantly more likely to say they planned to vote for Dems in the midterms. Not a huge effect, and hard to separate GOP struggles in high-SALT areas from suburban struggles more generally. But effect appears real.According to several months' worth of data from @SurveyMonkey, the tax law was significantly less popular in ZIP codes where a large share of people took the SALT deduction. That's true even after controlling for party, education, income, etc.Republicans thought their tax cut would help save them in the midterms. Instead, it looks like capping the SALT deduction hurt them in key races.

I'm hoping for a Twitter miracle here.Local job growth is driven by homegrown companies hiring, *not* by outside companies moving in. Yet econ development policies (incl. tax incentives) tend to focus on the latter, not the former.

New @urbaninstitute research:Trump's steel tariffs are giving a big boost to the profits of Nucor and other steelmakers. Job creation? Not so much.
From @TimAeppel.on Amazon subsidies: "If you’re a local retailer or small manufacturer or artist or writer or publisher, you’re watching as your city and state hands your tax dollars to your most ferocious antagonist" by @bencasselmanI wonder how much of the difference between NY and VA has to do with equalizing costs between the two sites. Crystal City Office space is surprisingly cheap. Guessing base rents in LIC are higher. Average tech-industry wage probably is too.Pictured: The “Opportunity Zone” — median income $138,000 — that is set to be Amazon’s new NYC home: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/us/politics/amazon-hq2-long-island-city.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share …Some good details on how the VA and NY incentives stack up in this thread.New York and Virginia offered over $2 billion in incentives to land Amazon’s new headquarters, not including what could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars more in promised spending. Our @bencasselman breaks down the numbers:So, did New York overpay for HQ2?Before Amazon could settle on New York, it had one last question: Could Cuomo and de Blasio get along?
Great reporting from @KYWeise & @jdavidgoodmanThe "best" (read: worst) part of reporting this HQ2 story is that there are about 27 different ways to add up the incentives numbers and even the various parties don't agree on the right one.Number 3 is more complicated. We're stuck in a loop where every city and state offers them and every business expects them (and site selectors profit off them). NYC could've called their bluff, but game theory etc.Now, those are as-of-right -- anyone who created those jobs/made those investments in those places would get those deals. But as @mariadoulis asks: Do we really need incentives to invest in LIC in 2018?Note that NY's reported $1.525 billion in incentives does *not* include as-or-right NYC incentives that could easily add another $1 billion or more to the total.A couple points of general agreement:
1. This is not Foxconn. The $$$ totals are big partly because the project is big. 
2. But New York offered a lot. (NY always offers a lot.)
3. Incentives are not what made the decision. Which does prompt the question: Why offer them?Amazon said its choice of New York and Virginia was about talent, not incentives. But that doesn't mean it'll turn down the $2 billion (bound to be more in the end) it was offered.New York and Virginia each got half of HQ2. So why did New York pay twice as much?They split HQ2 to get the talent they needed. They went to the biggest/smartest markets - despite higher costs - for the talent they needed. Yes, Amazon will get a pile of subsidies, but this was about talent.In which @bencasselman and @jimtankersley show that in the 2018 midterms it was, indeed, Not The Economy, StupidAmazon has singlehandedly accounted for 30% of all jobs in Seattle this decade.

And there will be lots of Ds from low-tax, low-income states who will have good reason to take a position other than "repeal the SALT cap."Listening to parents trying to comfort their children as they fled the California fires on today's "Daily" was absolutely gutting. @mikiebarb @kljohnsoNEW: The Trump administration has lost its sixth attempt to get the #2020census #citizenshipquestion lawsuits tossed out of court. U.S. District Judge George Hazel has rejected @TheJusticeDept’s motion to dismiss case in Maryland led by @LUPE_rgvThere is no sign of the strong economy helping Republicans in the midterms. None. @bencasselman and I have the re...gressions.Lastly, I will never forgive @vikasbajaj for not letting me title this chart "SALT Shaker."Note that the link between presidential elections and the economy has historically been much stronger. So get ready for an exciting two years of "Will the economy save Trump?" stories! (Or "Will the recession doom Trump?" Or, even more fun, "Did the Fed save/doom Trump?")Meanwhile, no sign Republicans outperformed in districts that got bigger tax cuts, per estimates from @taxfoundation. Republicans may have realized the law wasn't a winner -- many of them didn't talk much about the law on the campaign trail.What about the tax cuts? Republicans hoped it would be their ace in the hole. But law never polled much above 50%, and it looks like it may have *hurt* Republicans in some places. Several Dem pickups were in high-SALT districts (including VA-10).But note that a) historical relationship between economy and midterm results has been weak, and b) voters (especially dems/independents and *especially* women) didn't feel that great about the economy anyway. So not surprising it didn't have a big effect.Key caveat: It's possible that the economy affected the *national* picture, and that the blue wave would have been stronger had the economy been worse. That's the case @RepKevinBrady made to @RichardRubinDC earlier this week:(Nerd aside: We ran dozens of regressions, using various economic measures and controls. Sometimes the sign went one way, sometimes another, but overall it was almost impossible to discern any meaningful relationship between local economies and the midterm results.)And sure, unemployment isn't a great measure. But Democrats' gains came mostly in places where the economy is doing well by pretty much any metric. Just look at how they dominated districts that are rated "prosperous" by @innovateeconomy.Republicans actually *lost* five of the lowest-unemployment-rate districts in the country. On average, Republican incumbents performed modestly worse (both in absolute terms and relative to past elections) in districts with lower unemployment rates.Republicans hoped the strong economy would bail them out in the midterms.
It didn't.

Read into that what you will.Anyway, I don't know whether this is a happy coincidence or a sign of a larger shift. But for a year, at least, it seems that the "reporting vs data" wars have quieted down, or at least stumbled into some degree of agreement.But the divergence certainly doesn't seem as extreme as in 2012. Partly (mostly?) because the models are less confident, but also because the coverage does seem to reflect that the Dems are favored.My own (qualitative) assessment of the midterms' coverage is that it's hedging a bit more on the Dems' chances than the models are. Lots of stories about how the economy (or Kavanaugh, or the  caravan...) might bail out the Republicans.2016 is a tricky case, of course, because there was a lot of variation in the models. But my guess is they averaged out to about an 85% chance of a Clinton win, which is roughly where the models now show the Dems' House odds (albeit with a much tighter alignment).Contrast that to 2012, when qualitative estimates had Obama as an overwhelming favorite, and news coverage made it sound like a tossup. Or 2016, when models (on avg) showed Clinton as a strong-but-not-overwhelming favorite, and most coverage made her sound like a slam dunk.These results are broadly consistent with my own intuition, which is that qualitative coverage of the midterms is reasonably well aligned with the quantiative estimates. Both tend to boil down to, "Democrats are favored, but not by all that much."There's also pretty strong agreement among the various probabilistic forecasters on odds of a D House majority:

I can’t wait to learn from all of you! https://power.srccon.org/program/ The technology behind dynamic paywalls is cool, but as a reader, it’s infuriating to share stories & not know if they will be able to read. I’ve shared stories in group chats where only some can read, and it looks like something is wrong with the website.In February, a small church in Pennsylvania gained international attention when they held a blessing ceremony with AR-15's just two weeks after the Parkland School shooting. The church even has their own camo print.White women are the largest voting bloc in the United States.It’s @motherboard’s third annual hacking week, and our ultimate guide to protecting yourself is updated.We’re so excited to launch CYBER, Motherboard’s first-ever cybersecurity- and infosec-focused podcast.Watching @sisiwei inspire rooms full of women is a true blessing, and I’m excited to watch her do it again at WIJ.This is really good storytelling: conversationally written, context-adding graphics, personalized. https://www.vox.com/a/weather-climate-change-us-cities-global-warming …“Publishers simply don’t buy as many books by mothers of color, and it’s likely that many writers don’t pursue writing about their journeys with pregnancy and motherhood because they don’t believe they’ll be given a chance.”As the judges in Dubay's case concluded, a woman's right to abortion and a man's right to reject fatherhood are not quite analogous.Whenever I hear Joni Mitchell, I think of Love Actually. https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mzpb/joni-mitchell-best-songs-guide-playlist-essay …“We think these are just cosmetic alterations—changes to help Kim look a bit more handsome than he is in real life, much like a wedding photographer might make.

JAN 3rd!The New York State Senate will be filled to the brim with Democrats who have said that mass transit reform is a top priority. (I, for one, hope busses aren’t left out.)“My best advice for young men is to identify a woman as your mentor or hero.”“There are many little ways in which our electoral system isn’t even designed (nor prepared) for working-class people to lead,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. 12% of women have difficulty getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term, making fertility problems more common than asthma. Let’s use these celebrity moments to have much-needed conversation. And then let’s pay for the medical care.This in no way justifies capital letters. It’s important for celebrities to talk about fertility, but the way the media covers it shouldn’t make it feel like they are revealing a shameful secret. Replace “IVF” with “migraines” — does it sound ridiculous? Then rephrase..@MiamiNewTimes does excellent reporting like this every single week. Someone come be our managing editor: https://awc.careerwebsite.com/job/news-editor/44146503/ …A survey found that women are threatened with revenge porn considerably more than men, but that men and women are equally likely to have sensitive photos posted online without their consent.

Welcome to our marijuana coverage.Republican Josh Hawley usurped Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill in Missouri's Senate race — a nice payoff for the NRA, which spent more here than in any other federal election. https://www.thetrace.org/2018/11/nra-2018-election-results-gun-vote/ …Missouri’s Josh Hawley won tonight. He says he’s a proponent of protecting preexisting conditions, but he still wants to invalidate Obamacare, including the protections for preexisting conditions.Hello, Michigan. Welcome: https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/marijuana …If you’re relying on a newspaper or news site to tell you what’s happening in the elections, I hope you’re paying them for that important work. That bourbon you’re drinking tonight to celebrate or mourn isn’t free, and neither is journalism. Thank you.TONIGHT: Broadly politics writer @msolis14 will be taking over our account as she reports live from Georgia’s 6th congressional district, where Lucy McBath (@lucymcbath) is trying to flip the seat currently held by Republican Karen Handel. Stay tuned! #ElectionNightPolitico has my favorite election night live tracker.We asked students across the country today what issues mattered to them when they voted. Watch our Insta Story: https://instagram.com/vicereports And although the document indicates that customers will be prompted periodically by the system to change the passwords, the document instructs customers to re-use passwords in some cases.Georgia's 6th congressional district is a ripe opportunity for Democrats to flip one of the 23 seats they need to regain the House, but it's a bit of a sore spot for the party.New York democrats are looking to flip two seats in the state senate to give them the majority. They could take on issues like the RHA, which has been passed multiple times in the state assembly but has never been brought to the floor in the senate.How you're welcomed (or not) into a new job really sets the tone for yr time there. Onboarding should always be this good http://bit.ly/2SD3rgs  by @rschallom w/ @garveymcvgI was told this was the case at Thursday’s rally as well.I’m watching Netflix’s cooking show Nailed It, where bad bakers have to recreate professional cakes.

"...the beginning is the best time for managers to make sure employees are starting out with the right work habits."Interesting story with a lot of young people’s voices.Vice’s phone booths have red walls. I have not been held hostage. 

#MIZI love this story, reported by @msolis14. This is a conversation we should be having this week.Man, the liberal media is so biased with all their rules restricting campaigning, attending rallies, promoting their opinions and donating to candidates.Thanks to @lizziec22 for connecting us with @CoMissourian student @Tessa_Weinberg to cover Thursday’s Trump rally.I really enjoyed talking to @rschallom about my start at @KPCC (which wasn't even yet + @LAist). It's also a great reminder to make sure everyone feels just as welcome. I see you @write_this_way @onthatbombshell @alyssajperry @aaronschrank @eedugdaleI get so much value from #TheCohortNewsletter. Thanks @Poynter @rschallom and @barbara_allen_ for consistently creating one of the highlights of my inbox.

http://go.pardot.com/l/273262/2018-05-29/5l4lm …An actual LOL while reading @annfriedman: “Insisting they wear all clothing inside out because both sides are the same.”Happy Friday, journos! Last weekend ONA St. Louis held an event with @rschallom, managing editor at Vice. She led a great discussion on career development — check out her presentation below, it's full of useful links and advice.I see where this is coming from, but if Twitter killed the retweet function, we’d lose an easy way to amplify diverse voices and share others’ viewpoints with our audiences.Vice is throwing the Munchies cookbook party on Monday. Tickets include two drinks and a copy of the cookbook.The @StarTribune opts for no endorsements in the tight MN AG race, calling both candidates "too partisan to hold a statewide office wielding immense power and in which the public’s trust is so vital to its mission.""The way we onboard is crucial, both in the technical sense and the emotional."—@rschallom on @Poynter about how managers can improve their organizations in the ways they onboard a new team member https://bit.ly/2ziXgFH  #onboarding #mustreadIn this Vice series, called Why I Didn’t Vote, you’ll find personal essays from individuals who, for a variety of reasons, have faced structural barriers to the ballot box that have kept them from voting.The DSA’s success in electing candidates to office has spurred debate within the organization, as some members consider how best to leverage its newfound influence while others wonder if DSA should be invested in electoral politics at all.This from @rschallom's Cohort newsletter on onboarding/starting a new job is so key!! "It’s easy to make enemies if you implement new things without understanding the full context of the organization." http://go.pardot.com/webmail/273262/279461517/46d161fd146297de18fdf585e910add610d00bfde65c6d8431e3ad214cb3ed46 …“All of those things add up: You don’t have a desk. You don’t have a computer. Your phone doesn’t work. No one set up training. I think having that be organized just makes a big difference for someone walking in the door.” —@garveymcvgIn this week’s #TheCohortNewsletter, I talked to @garveymcvg about the importance of taking the time to do onboarding right.So much love to everyone who dressed up as Lara Jean this year. It means so very much to me. Thanks for letting me share on here.Vice’s YouTube channel hit 10 million subscribers When I am 10 pounds heavier, please blame the staff.I am about to revoke Vice’s accreditation as a newsroom. I took $67 worth of candy into work today and 95% of it is still available.VICE’s Munchies editor @rbhattacharya talks about our latest cookbook, which is out now (and makes a great holiday gift).Facebook’s “Paid for by” feature — one of the efforts to make political ads more transparent — is easily manipulated and appears to allow anyone to lie about who is paying for a political ad, or to pose as someone paying for the ad.I’ve shared @millie’s “What am I going to do with my life???” deck with so many people. Here’s the backstory:They are SO lucky to have you.This thread is the best thing I’ve read todaySince 1992, 1,324 journalists have been killed on the job, and 849 of them were executed for their work. But in nearly 90% of these murders, the people who ordered the attacks escaped justice. #ImpunityIndexIt is a true embarrassment that this is still happening three years into Trump's incessant lying. The single easiest fix for news outlets/wire services to make is to stop uncritically reprinting his false claims in their headlines and tweets. https://twitter.com/AP_Politics/status/1057239601834811392 …Studies have routinely shown that these networks provide cheaper and better broadband service, in large part because these ISPs have a vested interest in the communities they serve.#teamdomesticpartnershipThis is an excellent example of how journalism can bring context to give readers a more complete picture.The researchers found that people of low cognitive ability (lower IQ) are prejudiced against groups that people didn't choose to be part of, such as ethnic or LGBT groups.In this era of mass school shootings, upstate New York students will soon be monitored by a sophisticated new surveillance system that scans their faces, looking for matches to the school’s security database.“What is it about women walking with men that makes other men behave themselves?”Looking at my email drafts from Friday evening, and I started an email that was just “How can we” and I have no idea where I was going with that.It’s a great time to sign up for end-of-the-year professional development. Women in journalism can sign up for free coaching from some of the most amazing women I know here:I buy a lot of things on Amazon. Here are the ones I highly recommend.I’m trying to read more about the new LaGuardia plans, so please feel free to send links my way, but my initial reaction is it would be incredibly shortsided to not include transit across Brooklyn, as well.Where’s the best place to donate clothes in the Prospect Lefferts Gardens area/Brooklyn neighborhoods that are easy to get to via subway?All speaking engagements should involve mimosas.We had a great time learning about professional development from @rschallom this morning. Thanks so much to @onastl for hosting the event!Refusing to accommodate pregnant women is often completely legal. If companies treat their nonpregnant employees terribly, they have every right to treat their pregnant employees terribly as well.This is like when Silicon Valley thought they invented busses.It is now legal to hack many consumer electronics. #RightToRepairI had surgery in May and two smaller procedures in September, and this is so real.Starting next weekend, VICE is partnering with @smorgasburg to bring you Night Market. Every Friday in Brooklyn we’ll be serving up delicious food & drinks with  music & programming from VICE. Admission is free when you RSVP or buy a ticket for perks.First one in the newsroom. I am not a morning person at all — I can easily sleep until 11 on the weekends — but I get my best work done before the chaos of the day starts. So now I’m challenging myself to get up earlier so I can head home when my brain is zapped after meetings.Me, talking to myself, every morning

They cover Twitter bots, fake news, and our addiction to screens. https://bit.ly/2AukZ7y Bolsonaro's win in Brazil tonight marks the end of the first Facebook elections. Here's a piece I've been working on for almost four years new:

Here’s How A Handful Of American Tech Companies Radicalized The World
https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-facebook-elections … via @BuzzFeedNewsIn which I borrow/steal a slide from @noUpside, who gives way better presentations.Giving a #CrunchConf keynote tomorrow on machine learning and information warfare. Come hang out if you're in town. @crunchbpWe convinced ourselves that Dylan Roof was an isolated incident. Charlottesville quickly faded from memory. This week a domestic terrorist tried to assassinate a dozen politicians and 11 people were killed by a white supremacist.

What's our excuse this time?The perpetrator of the tragic synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh--a horrible anti-Semitic sequel to Dylann Roof's attack--appears to have been a white supremacist. For the current state of that hateful movement, see our recent report at https://www.adl.org/new-hate-and-old ….The social network used by the Pittsburgh shooter, a safe haven for Nazis, bigots, and other users kicked off mainstream social media platforms, is celebrating the increased attention today's attack has brought to their platform. 

Stay classy, Gab. https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1056280401516224512 …I went through 3,000 of Cesar Sayoc's tweets going back to Jan/2017 & it's scary how corrupted his mind was by every far right conspiracies from Podesta child sacrifices, to Obama being a Muslim, to Pizzagate. Also noticeable how his rhetoric got more threatening as time went on.Radicalization didn't start on mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook. It was festering for years in spaces you never think about, like the comments section of Breitbart after Steve Bannon took the helm.Rising anti-Semitism isn't isolated to Twitter. In early 2017 I wrote about increased extremism in conservative spaces on Facebook.Researchers who study online radicalization have been sounding the alarm about domestic extremism. Today's attack in Pittsburgh didn't come from nowhere. Here's my @washingtonpost article from two years ago about the sharp rise of anti-Semitism on TwitterI’m at #mozfest - speaking at 12:45pm. The tl;dr slide is below. Come hang out!We've been tracking social media activity around the #migrantcaravan currently making its way north through Mexico. We analyzed over 2 million tweets from Oct 23–26. Here's what we found...With ISIS, one of the main reasons we worried about social media radicalization was the fear that it inspired "lone wolf" acts of violence. 

We've convinced ourselves that it's different when the terrorists are foreign but the pattern is the same.the NYT's bothsides fetish has led them to print some pretty nonsensical stuff but "The Case For Mail-Bombing These Guys" is a real showstopperThe most high volume, hyperactive accounts on social media are more likely to share conspiracy theories, while low-volume accounts link to mainstream outlets. Even when it's not "bots", this asymmetry gives the conspiracy groups outsized impact on public conversation.Case in point.Closed, homogenous information spaces (social media filter bubbles), powered by recommendation engines, all optimized for engagement (and therefore the most polarizing content), are radicalization machines.Other researchers like @intelwire dedicated entire research papers to the topic, noting that far-right extremism is more common on social media than terrorist groups like ISIS http://news.intelwire.com/2016/09/nazis-vs-isis-on-twitter.html?m=1 …This week's bomb threats make clear the links between violent rhetoric, social media, and radicalization. It doesn't happen in a vacuum, and we've been sounding the alarm about domestic extremism for years. Here's an article I wrote about this in 2016#MAGABomber Thread - I've been digging through the bombers tweets, seeing what info can be gleaned from them, they really tell a story:Meanwhile, on the Great America app:I'm tracking hoaxes, conspiracy theories, and other misleading stuff about the bombs devices.

2. @alexismadrigal on how old people can’t tell fact from opinionHere's a pretty good—and still not even remotely comprehensive—compendium of all the times Reddit's r/The_Donald called for the killing of George Soros in the last week, from r/AgainstHateSubreddits.

It's always irony until it isn't.support US leaning forward in cyber offensive against known persistent Russia threat. Should have happened earlier, but if US warn election meddlers & don’t follow through w/ punch when warnings are ignored, can make US appear even weaker. Interested in what the punch will beIf only we'd had some earlier indication that Richard Spencer is a terrible person.The ongoing cyber warfare attacks aren't focused on a single country.  Rather, they are an attack on liberal democracy globally.  We need to rethink the way that we coordinate and respond collectively.Want to be on the front lines developing solutions to disinformation?

Learn more and keep up with disinformation news and developments at http://www.disinfo2018.com Thinking about the Afghan elections, where people are going to vote despite the threat of attacks from the Taliban and ISIS. In California, my neighbor isn’t going to vote because he, “never votes in the midterms.” It’s, “too much to figure out all the candidates/propositions.”In light of yesterday's indictments and Twitter's disclosure last week, we are monitoring a still-active network of 800 accounts commenting on US politics that we believe are linked to Russia. We setup a dashboard so you can track their activity with us: https://www.disinfo2018.com/ The most effective way to counter hybrid influence is to expose the perpetrators, their means, and their controllers.

Kudos to @NewKnowledgeAI for sharing this.With three weeks to go until the midterms, couldn't sit on this any longer. We stood up a dashboard to track a network of ~800 still-active accounts linked to Russia.And to subvert US laws about political speech, Russian operatives worked through American proxies to spread propaganda on platforms with more stringent identity verification, like Facebook.Unlike traditional warfare, information war has fuzzy boundaries. The @nytimes revealed today that McKinsey, a US consulting firm, helped the Saudi government identify dissidents on Twitter (who were later imprisoned)Tech platforms, security companies, and researchers have made it more difficult to run influence operations on social media. Now we're in an arms race. Under reported in coverage of yesterday's indictments, Russia's troll farm doubled its budget in 2018We now know that Saudi Arabia (in addition to Russia and China) cultivated human assets in the US to support their disinformation campaigns.

This is information warfare. It's time to treat this as a fundamental threat to our national security.New from me and @Geneva_Sands:

US intel community and Silicon Valley have upped their game when it comes to tackling disinformation, but as yesterday’s DOJ complaint shows, it hasn’t stopped the Russians from trying. Russians spending big $$$$ on this.Elena Khusyaynova charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. Managed the finances of "Project Lakhta," a foreign influence operation designed to sow discord in issues including immigration, the Confederate flag, gun control, and the NFL national anthem protests."A criminal complaint was unsealed here today charging a Russian national for her alleged role in a Russian conspiracy to interfere in the U.S. political system, including the 2018 midterm election."Russian trolls called for Russian trolls to be locked up in Gitmo.

Why would Russia care about an in-state race in Minnesota? Here's what we're seeing...Twitter publishing millions of Russian & Iranian propaganda tweets ended up highlighting the extent to which social media is filled with shit, @jonathonmorgan tells meIf you haven't kept up with Twitter's release of millions of tweets relating to foreign influence campaigns, our Director of Research @noUpside and @politico have you covered.A number of IRA and Iranian assets are apparently still live on Facebook, Gab, Telegram, LiveJournal, and other sites - indicating a more expansive operation than has been reported previously. Here's some examples...AI has a hard time beating humans even at tweeting BSAt @NewKnowledgeAI we found a botnet (still active as of this morning!) Russia probably rented in 2016 because the accounts were spamming about free Taco Bell before they started tweeting about politics. 

Think outside the...bot?A botnet used by Russian trolls is still on Twitter, and it promoted Taco Bell and Coachella. Research from @jonathonmorgan and @josh_emerson here:Crucial takeaway from our analysis of the data Twitter released this morning. Obsession with "Russian bots" is overblown. Bots were part of the operation but the most influential activity was conducted by real people.We did an analysis of the IRA Twitter data (Iran still to come...) I want to expand with some more nuance about “divisive issues”. So, the IRA was focused on reinforcing in-group/out-group dynamics...NOT actively getting people into twitter fights.We analyzed the new data @Twitter reused about Russian influence. Highlights:

- Russia engaged 1.4M users
- the accounts they operated mostly weren't bots
- they established credibility by tweeting innocuous content before turning to politics

More Russia and Iran are engaged in disinformation campaigns aimed at US citizens. Twitter just released over 10 million tweets from over 4500 Russian and Iranian accounts engaged in influence operations dating back to 2009. We've analyzed the data. Here's what you need to know...Big uptick in content about the  Khashoggi disappearance from a Russian disinformation network we're monitoring at @NewKnowledgeAI.

Some highlights follow. Maybe you can learn or teach something with this stuff.Everyone says they want to work on "hard, meaningful problems". But, working on "hard, meaningful problems" means failing to succeed most of the time and feeling like you're failing to succeed most of the time. It's not as glamorous as it seems.Just experienced Leeked Recipes - a 4 course dinner with food cooked from recipes from leaked corporate emails, also with quizzes and conspiracy theories! Some of the best immersion happens away from the tech @DocLabOne of the more redacted public records responses I’ve ever gotten back from a school district. #publicrecords #openrecordsThere is a contradiction at the heart of how lawyers talk about risk assessment: predictions can only be based on the past actions of "similar" people. Anything else is a wild guess, unsupported by evidence. "Individualized assessment" is not actually possible.Good review article on risk scores / fair ML, focussed on the context of the criminal justice system as opposed to the mathy bits."No Morals" was listed in my Twitter trends last night, and it was amazing how many different things people were complaining about under that hashtag.

Innovative. https://www.impacto.jor.br/ Journalists often make mistakes when reporting on poll results, jobs reports, census surveys, etc. because they don’t quite understand — or don't know to look for — the data’s margin of error.  This tip sheet will help you avoid margin-of-error errors.Basic reason equalizing false positive rate (or really any classifier metric) isn't going to get you "fairness" in criminal justice risk scores: FPR depends on both the classifier and who the police are arresting. Start arresting many low risk people -> lower FPR.Pleased to see that Fox News understands this.TIL @librarycongress has a page full of APIs and machine readable data, called "LC for Robots"Maybe tech like social media or VR don't really make the world "better."

Not as glamorous as historic identity wins (also cool!), but so structurally important.Election results aren't always really about... the results.This is why false positive rates are not a good measure of classifier bias, and equalized FPR is neither necessary nor sufficient for fairness. We've learned a lot since ProPublica's influential "Machine Bias," and FPR analysis should not be used again.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 Fairness in machine learning doesn't mean equalizing false positive rates -- which can harm both minority and majority groups. https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023 Cryptocurrency completes the technology industry’s long transformation from idealism to avarice.If you're in New York next week, come learn how to work with data without coding, starring @workbenchdataEvery data journalist hopes their work is reproducible, but that requires scripting every operation.

This is, of course, contained in Twitter's metadata. 

https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/6357 I'm a little surprised that horse-race articles like this are still being written. "All the polls and all the models say GOP will lose the House, but I think they're wrong because of these anecdotes."I've been pessimistic about Civil, the journalism-on-the-blockchain startup, because I don't believe that blockchain solves any fundamental issues here. Seems other potential funders felt the same (via @theinformation)From now on I’m calling any neural network method “derp learning.”Preview of tomorrow's algo fairness talk:

1. Most formal measures of fairness are poor indicators of bias
2. Attempts to satisfy these measures can lead to biased decisions
3. Idea that there are trade-offs between different measures is largely illusoryEveryone interested in algorithmic bias in predicting who will be re-arrested should learn how the bail process actually works, and where these risk scores fit in. @Swykstr has written the ultimate primer.This has got to apply to journalists asking questions as well.Netflix has committed to finance and release The #Laundromat, a Steven Soderbergh-directed drama about the #PanamaPapers scandal @DEADLINE https://buff.ly/2RAHluF Literal weaponization of social media.

(1/13)People readily confuse correlation with causation. 

Scatter plots contribute in a subtle way, because we think of the x variable as independent and y as dependent. 

We consider why this happens and propose a solution for dealing with it: diamond plots.

https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09328 Quick thread collating recent research on media — old and new — and political polarisation:

tl;dr we obsess over social media filter bubbles, but evidence suggests old media and the least "social" of new media (partisan news sites, not social platforms) are the real problemOur lit review debunking the echo chamber about the prevalence of echo chambers https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media_elements/files/000/000/133/original/Topos_KF_White-Paper_Nyhan_V1.pdf …Sorry, that should be "old users -- who spend less time online -- are getting more polarized at a *faster* rate"Hi Jonathan! We agree with you: “there is little empirical evidence that warrants any worries about filter bubbles.” https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2758126 …Finally, the increasing polarization in American politics goes back decades. In other words, it started long before there were search engines or social media. More diverse recommendation algorithms may be worthwhile, but they're not the cause of our ideological bubbles. (5/5)In fact, it seems internet use correlates with *less* polarization. Older users -- who spend less time online -- are getting more polarized at a slower rate than younger users. https://qz.com/937216/no-one-really-knows-whats-causing-us-political-polarization-but-its-not-the-internet/ … (4/5)Meanwhile recommendations from your social network can actually be quite diverse because weak ties are very numerous -- and they tend to hold different than your closest friends. This 2015 Facebook study showed this happening. https://research.fb.com/exposure-to-diverse-information-on-facebook-2/ … (3/5)First off, recommendation algorithms often produce much more "diverse" output than human editors. Here's a head-to-head comparison, on a corpus of Dutch news articles and their human-chosen "related article" recommendations. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1444076 … (2/5)I'm skeptical of the existence of filter bubbles. Or rather, polarization is very real, but it doesn't seem like recommendation algorithms are causing it. Here are some references to make that argument. Do you know of more? 1/5New @metric album!!@DJSnM do you know anything about this odd site, and its creator?I suspect this may be the first journalism manifesto that boasts, "We do not p-hack.'The gravity assist maneuver opened up our solar system to exploration. Here’s a site with hundreds of rare documents that chronicles its discovery and development  in the early 1960s... because the key researcher has some sort of dispute with JPL http://www.gravityassist.com/ What's changed in finance since the 2008 crisis. Systemically, not much. An actually informative infographic.Earlier this year Twitter asked for proposals to develop metrics for conversational health. Such metrics are the key link between values and technology. These are the researchers Twitter has chosen to work with and what they're doing.Today's coding music: Reggae Dub playlist on Spotify. Really what I want is lots more of the sound of The Orb's "Perpetual Dawn" but I have no idea where to find that.This topic is super tricky -- it's technically complex, philosophically unresolved, and pretty much everyone who wants to look at the data already thinks they know the answer. I think we can all do better here, but only by acknowledging the challenges. 3/3Here are several dozen statistical definitions of bias https://speak-statistics-to-power.github.io/fairness/  Most of these collapse to just three http://fairml.how/tutorial/index.html#/three-criteria … This work is in context of ML, but again, applies to *any* measurement of biased outcomes, even if no machines 2/3Generally, quantitative measures of race/gender bias are... problematic. There isn't consensus on what "bias" means, hence the plethora of definitions, and there are big problems with confounders. Same problems apply equally to human-only and machine-assisted decisions. 1/3Good summary of evidence U.S. criminal justice system is racially biased. The methodological issues here are super tricky, and I know some of these studies and I have questions. But the most consistent explanation is that the bias is real and pervasive.Finally: we're going to to get reverse chron tweets back. I find the standard Twitter client useless, because its recommendations are mostly just whatever is most controversial and popular. The whole point of the Internet is to be able to get niche.This is Spielberg talking about Minority Report in 2002, also weird to think that we're still using the first major mainstream Hollywood summer blockbuster released after 9/11 as visual shorthand for "the future"another day, another unnecessary flash of annoyance at usage of stills from"Minority Report" as stock imagery for What If The Algorithms Are Bad takes when the villain in Minority Report is rmainly a guy who murders a lady and there's no systemic critiqueGetting ready for the 3pm workshop at #D4GX @TechAtBloomberg on the 20202 Census.

I just love the glitch-pop sound of this whole album.I use the Titantic passenger data set in a number of my introductory data classes and thought it held no more secrets, but I was wrong. This has to be the most thorough and sophisticated analysis yet.Internet gold, and a reminder that everyone, even conspiracy theorists, can benefit from a 30 second fact check before retweeting.

(To begin with, Rousseau doesn’t work at Reddit.)Machine Learning 
Emily: that’s just regression 
Me: no, see it has a monocleGawker's coming back.I'm pretty pleased with this toy election predictor we built. It gives Clinton a 99% chance in 2016. This was a way to get into the perils of correlated errors, not just elections but e.g. the 2007 financial crash. Adding correlated polls brings us to 70%.Statistical puzzle: If you want to use simulation see how unlikely it is that some subset of a random set of campaign payments add to $130,000, how many random payments in each set? This touches on a deep question in frequentist inference. https://github.com/jstray/lede-algorithms/blob/master/week-6/stormy-daniels-payments-simulation.ipynb …"In less than a month, we were hit by extreme leftists and extreme rightists, both with the same argument: that fact-checking is a way to censor their opinions on social media"We did one class on "feature engineering" -- for example the nuts and bolts of doing machine learning on text and categorical data. The homework was creating a bill topic classifier that reads legislation and tells you the subject.And here's me teaching linear regression and controlling for variables and stuff like that using examples in journalism work.Some of you may remember an analysis of campaign finance payments that suspiciously add up to $130,000 just before Stormy Daniels was paid. Basically a significance testing argument. But that analysis had some problems, so I replicated it and critiqued itThis notebook uses real loan data, from Lending Club, to look at how who gets a loan changes when it's possible to more accurately predict who will repay. Are poor people suddenly denied credit?We looked at all sorts of notions of algorithmic bias, including data quality and how the output is used. And we analyzed who might win and lose if more companies can more accurately predict who will repay a loan.We deconstructed ProPublica's famous "Machine Bias" piece on the COMPAS arrest risk score algorithm, including replicating the analysis, analyzing the limits of predictability, and modifying the classifier for different notions of fairness.Significance testing has been used in investigative journalism to look for insider trading, tennis fixing, and Trump's payments to Stormy Daniels. Here's a collection of notes and notebooks.I created a game called "Kitchen Confusion Matrix" where you act out how classifier-based prediction works, and the idea that differential false positive rates between groups might be unjust -- a common type of machine learning bias.I used @rachel_shorey and @jeremybmerrill's "Lights Camera Algorithm" to teach decision trees. And then I extended it next class to tech confusion matrices.We get into text analysis pretty early. Here are some materials that teach TF-IDF.The course is 6 weeks and covers text analysis, machine learning, election prediction, simulations, and algorithmic accountability. Prerequisite is basic Python/Pandas. We go through a notebook in class together and then there's a homework notebook.A certain strand of thought holds that journalism is really about "storytelling." I'm sympathetic, but a good story must never get in the way of a true story. In data work, this means we should be asking questions rather than proving the answers.When it comes to document management, @documentcloud has great features. But what if you need to analyze hundreds of thousands of documents? @alastairotter suggests using @overviewproject, a document-mining tool built with investigative journalists in mind https://buff.ly/2LXi8X8 Manual stylometry happening here. (This is also how the Unabomber was identified.) Oh boy. Is this about to become another journosec cautionary tale?Wow, NYT published an anonymous White House op-ed. Keeping the source safe requires some serious opsec. I hope they considered:
- devices used to compose it
- channels used to transmit and store it
- info that only the author may have
- writing style, and perhaps anti-stylometryThe reproduction crisis is just the dawn of empirical error rate control. We've been using statistical significance testing methods to try to control rate, but now we're measuring too. And getting meta: it's possible to guess which studies will reproduce.Using AI to detect AI generated fakes is likely to get less effective over time. Or so I assume, because we'll use adversarial networks to train the fakes. Does anyone know of a technical or academic discussion of this argument?What if the real art was the spreadsheets we made along the way~"A good definition of a statistical argument is one in which many small pieces of evidence, often contradictory, are combined to produce an overall conclusion."

A victory for the First Amendment and a free and independent press.The tables/heat maps in @StatModeling's latest post are incredible https://andrewgelman.com/2018/11/16/2018-how-did-people-actually-vote-the-real-story-not-the-exit-polls/ … The urban-rural, educational, and ethnic divides were already enormous, and they keep growing #dataviz #infographics #ddjY'all plot1. Probabilistic election forecasts work. 
2. They're best way to answer the (pretty narrow) question of who's ahead/behind.

It's that the only plan we seem to have for this mess is to trust them to fix it.I wrote a little about Scott McCloud and Understanding Comics on Data and Dragons, only to discover that he did a fantastic episode on the @datastories podcast last year! Check it out here: http://datastori.es/102-comics-and-visual-storytelling-with-scott-mccloud/ …Thank you @bongshin and @hadleywickham for speaking with @albertocairo’s class. It was especially great to hear your thoughts about the importance of programming.They also shrugged when it was discovered that they collected phone numbers for two factor authentication which they then sold to advertisers. It's great that the media is now exposing many of these unsavory practicesToday @bongshin and @hadleywickham are visiting my intro to #dataviz class at @UMInteractive. Tonight they are both presenting at VizUM https://ccs.miami.edu/vizum-2018/ If you work in journalism I strongly recommend you listen to @ezraklein's interview with @wphillips49 about trolls and how they take advantage of media https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast … I'm getting her books right awayHello #Miami, VizUM, our #dataviz symposium, begins today at 4PM: https://ccs.miami.edu/vizum-2018/  with @bongshin and @hadleywickhamHi all,

My friends are launching a journalism startup called The Correspondent. It's the opposite of pivot-to-video: in-depth, critical, ad-free. They're trying to get enough memberships in advance so they can hire a bunch of journalists. More here —>So this NYT story says that Facebook leadership planted stories in right-wing media spreading an anti-semitic Soros conspiracy theory ... and also that Schumer told Warner to call off the dogs on Russiagate while this was going down.Let me repeat. New York Times is reporting that Facebook hired Republican lobbyists firms to paint people opposing its policies as Soros puppets...I read it. It's goodGreat!The Trump Train is on track to defeat in 2020. Would be better for the party and country not to renominate him in the first place.In Utah’s 4th House district, the Democrat — Ben McAdams — led after the initial vote count. The Republican — Mia Love — has closed the gap since Election night. The outcome remains unclear. 

Funny, you don’t hear much whining or conspiracy theorizing about that vote count.This picture is a middle finger to the democratic process. Rick Scott is not an incoming Senator at the moment. There is an ongoing recount and military ballots that remain to be counted.In a time when “brilliant” is widely overused, this is truly brilliant. Read it to understand Trump.Some insight into the book, from Nigel:Another important point in this interview: “It remains startling to me how little many men have to do to earn intellectual authority, and how much more women have to do to earn intellectual authority. It is stolen from them, it is undermined”“The retreat of humanists from public life has had enormous consequences for the prestige of humanistic ways of knowing and understanding the world” Jill LeporeAnother visual essay worth your time #dataviz #ddjI finally got around to trying #gganimate. I made this visualization for the bioinformatics class @ClausWilke and I are teaching next semester. I am hoping this will help students understand how ROC curves behave for different linear predictors. #rstatsIf you work in #dataviz #ddj, computational journalism —and want to enjoy some good weather in the middle of the winter, join us for the Computation+Journalism Symposium http://cplusj.org Hi #Miami, VizUM is TOMORROW. Sign up for free here: https://ccs.miami.edu/vizum-2018/  and come listen to @bongshin and @hadleywickham #dataviz #infographics #ddjWe already knew here in #SouthFlorida that Rubio is too ignorant, unprincipled, and unqualified to be a Senator. Now with his effort to undermine confidence in the democratic process, he's shown to the rest of the nation what we also knew: he's nothing more than a regime puppetYes! #dinosaur + #dataviz = datasaurus huh @albertocairo ?That's an abominationNazi dataviz.

Mimi Walters (R), 116,732 to 116,471. Increasingly shaping up as another loss for the GOP.Trump is helping the Democrats repair the damage of the Obama years: Dems regained in a night almost a third of the seats they lost over a decade. Amazing what *showing up* can do. 
Dems: Congrats!
GOP: Take a bow, everyone, good workIn Wisconsin Governor race, all counties that cast 50,000 votes or more moved in a Dem direction. A lot of smaller counties moved more Rep or were close to unchanged (the black diagonal line.) This was true of large GOP counties (Waukesha, Washington, Ozaukee) and large DemPhotoViz #datavizThis is like if Sauron wrote an op-ed about the danger of being seduced by a ring of power and becoming a Nazgûl as a resultThe top priority in 2022 for #SouthFlorida should be to elect someone who doesn't embarrass us so often. Either an alternative Republican or a DemocratGreat question @albertocairo! I think this is a good start.

Tell yo friends The recent rhetoric from Trump, and often other Republicans, trying to delegitimize election results is awfully dangerous. Maybe the most openly authoritarian move he's made so far.Seems my opponent is worried he'll lose this election if all the votes are counted. Why else would he sue to stop every vote from being counted?  Why make false charges of voter fraud?  We won't allow him to undermine the democratic process this way.Our @Cronkite_ASU is the only journalism program in the nation to win multiple Student Edward R.
